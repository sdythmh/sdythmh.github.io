    <div class="post-body" itemprop="articleBody">

      
        <p>First, I want to explain why I’m writing this and why I’m doing it in English. The reason for writing is mainly because I’m afraid of forgetting some details. A few years down the line, I will remember this experience, but the specifics will likely fade. I also want to use this as a way to constantly remind myself. In my view, these essays are for recording my own thoughts, not for others to read. The reason for writing in English is simple: I don’t want to see these painful memories repeatedly or the related terms. Writing in English provides a sort of buffer. Additionally, it prevents those with lower education (who can’t understand English) from getting involved. Of course, if you use translation software, I can’t stop you. :)</p>
<p>Writing in English does have a downside, though. English cannot capture the unique beauty of some Chinese phrases, but that’s okay. For a topic like this, simplicity is probably better.</p>
<p>Let’s first talk about what happened during my summer vacation this year, the one between my sophomore and junior years.</p>
<p>In the second semester of my sophomore year, around May 2024, one evening, I accidentally found a key on the front desk of the security guard at the School of Foreign Languages. The key had “379” written on it. I used it to open room 379, which is the Youth League Committee office of the School of Humanities and Arts. During the day, they work there, but at night, the entire second and third floors are empty. This was undoubtedly the perfect place for me to study after the teaching building closed at 11 PM. I usually studied in Building 33 during the day and then came to room 379 in the evening, studying until about 1 AM before returning to my dormitory. My roommates sleep quite late as well, so I didn’t worry about disturbing them. In fact, sometimes they came back even later than I did.</p>
<p>I prefer to study alone because I often listen to online courses. Wearing headphones for long periods can make my ears hurt, and studying alone allows me to play audio out loud. Besides, studying alone is more efficient. You can compare the efficiency of a couple studying together and someone studying alone; who do you think is more productive? Moreover, being alone gives me more freedom with my time. If I want to relax, I can play music out loud and lean back in my chair to enjoy a few minutes, something you definitely can’t do in a library.</p>
<p>Of course, being alone has its downsides. It’s a harsh test for people with poor self-control. I kept this lifestyle for about half a month. During this time, I discovered other keys in room 379 for the third-floor rooms, and I opened them one after another. Eventually, I settled on studying in rooms 379 and 374. Around June 1, 2024, which was a weekend, I came to room 379 as usual. Unable to suppress my curiosity, I found a student’s party membership application on the table. After flipping through it, I made some changes and even wrote inappropriate comments at the end of the application. I don’t remember the specific inappropriate comments, but I did insult Xi Jinping and the Communist Party of China. I realized I had gone too far after doing this, so I hid the document on top of the cabinet, thinking no one would find it. Unexpectedly, the following Tuesday, I came to room 379 as usual, but everything had changed. All cabinets were locked, and the keys were gone. It seemed like everything had been searched thoroughly; they were probably looking for the document. Even at this point, I wasn’t too concerned. I didn’t expect that about half an hour after I entered, the police arrived. They started asking about the whereabouts of the document. Initially, they didn’t think I had stolen it until someone found a large file on top of the cabinet. Now that I think about it, maybe this was fate. They managed to find it, so I couldn’t deny it. At first, I didn’t admit it, but eventually, I had to. When they saw the three lines of inappropriate comments I had written, they decided to take me back to the police station for further questioning.</p>
<p>After gathering evidence at the School of Foreign Languages, the police went to my dormitory to search. They thought I had hidden keys, and when they found a bunch of keys, they took all my electronic devices and me to the police station.</p>
<p>At the police station, the first thing they did was take a statement. I detailed my actions, much more thoroughly than I’m writing now. That evening, Officer Wang Dongliang and Officer Su Zhongwei took my statement. They checked my phone, looked through my Twitter and Telegram chat records, and asked why I wrote the inappropriate comments. Honestly, I don’t know why I wrote them. At the time, I was already a probationary party member, and I knew what I should and shouldn’t do. Maybe it was just an impulsive moment, along with a sense of luck, thinking no one would find out. After taking the statement, I spent the night in an empty bed in the police station’s duty officer’s dormitory. My right hand was handcuffed to the radiator next to me. That night, I experienced the pain of not having a sense of time for the first time, and the cold air conditioning blowing on me kept me awake all night. It was the longest night I’ve ever had.</p>
<p>Around 8 AM the next day, I was still in the interrogation room. During this time, several people came in and asked me about my reasons. Some people searched my Dell laptop again. Later, it was time for the police to take evidence and record statements, so they arranged for me to sit in their dormitory, with a police officer playing games watching over me. They probably called my counselor, the victim, people from the School of Humanities and Arts, security personnel, and others, but I’m not sure. Around 6 PM, my parents arrived at the police station. Yes, they drove from Yantai to Tianjin, which took about six or seven hours. Accompanied by the college’s party secretary, my parents took me out of the police station.</p>
<p>There was another side story. I once found an old laptop in room 294. It was very old and seemed to be broken, so I took it back to my dormitory, thinking I could repair it and use it. But this laptop was several years old, incomparable to my gaming laptop. Maybe I was confused at the time and brought it back to my dorm. However, there was a label from the School of Foreign Languages on the back of the laptop, which later became key evidence against me. If I had removed that label back then, nothing would have happened. But I didn’t, and maybe that was fate too. Therefore, when they asked, I lied again, saying I found it in a classroom, so it couldn’t be considered “burglary.” But that night, I told my parents the truth, and the next day, They called the police officer to explain the situation.</p>
<p>After leaving the police station that night, we had a simple dinner and then went to a hotel to rest. Of course, my parents asked many times about the reason. Honestly, I don’t even know the reason. Maybe it was a moment of impulse, destiny, or my personality. After sleeping for a night, the next day, we went to the College of Intelligence and Computing to find my counselor and the party secretary to explain the situation. In the afternoon, my parents bought me a new phone and left for Yantai that evening after dropping me back at school.</p>
<p>Then it was the final exam week. Since all my devices were taken away, I postponed exams like College English IV, Computer Networks, Digital Logic and Digital Systems, and Discrete Mathematics. On the last day of the exam week, while they were taking the Discrete Mathematics exam, I was already on the train back home.</p>
<p>You think that’s the end of it?</p>
<p>I thought so too at first. Shortly after returning home, I started preparing for competitions and research, getting ready to start my life anew. But did you think the police would let you start over so easily? On the afternoon of July 11, I received a call from Officer Wang Dongliang, asking me to come to the police station for a review of the record. So, on the morning of July 12, I took the train to the Tongyan Road Police Station again. Upon arrival, Officer Wang made a phone call saying, “He’s here,” and I knew things were bad. They mainly asked about the details of the laptop, and I confessed that I had taken it from room 294. Then they took me to the School of Humanities and Arts to identify the scene. Afterward, they took me to the Jinnan Branch of the Tianjin Municipal Public Security Bureau. There, I underwent various physical exams and provided my personal information, and they took another detailed personal statement (probably for sentencing purposes). I spent nearly four hours in the glass room. During this time, I repeatedly asked to go to the bathroom or said I felt like vomiting, hoping to stay outside a little longer. Initially, the police officers there agreed, but later they called a doctor. When they found I was not physically abnormal, I had no choice but to sleep in the glass room. The glass room was the hardest part because there was no concept of time, space, or direction in there. Around 10 PM, the police gave me a detention notice, charging me with “picking quarrels and provoking trouble” + “theft,” and I was administratively detained for 10+5&#x3D;15 days. Around 11 PM, I was sent to the detention center, where I completed the admission procedures and was finally put into a cell.</p>
<p>Well, that’s how it goes. After going in, I found that many people inside had been “tricked” into it by the police, just like me. Fortunately, the environment inside was okay, and people took care of each other. Breakfast was cornbread（窝窝头） and rice porridge. Lunch and dinner were usually boiled vegetables, such as stewed cabbage, stewed potato slices, and stewed salted vegetables. Sometimes there were carrots, peppers, eggplants, etc., with steamed buns as the staple food. About seven or eight people lived in a 20-square-meter room. We slept on a kang-style bed. Every day at 6 AM, we got up, and then it was time to wash up. You needed to fetch water to wash your face. Every morning after breakfast, we just sat there. It was a long morning where you had to follow instructions. If the weather was good, there would be time to go outside until lunch. After lunch, there was a break, and in the afternoon, you sat again until dinner. After dinner was free time. You could play cards, watch TV, or sleep during free time. At around 9 PM, you could make your bed, and at 11 PM, the TV was forcibly turned off, but the lights stayed on, forcing you to sleep.</p>
<p>You could send clothes and money in there. The money was mainly for buying daily toiletries or snacks like instant noodles, sausages, salted duck eggs, etc., which improved the food somewhat. At first, I didn’t have any instant noodles, but later the police gave me a box of instant noodles. I calculated the day I would go out and ate two packets a day to finish them exactly. I also met a friend inside who was eight years older than me. He used to study at the Tianjin Conservatory of Music and later got into trouble while delivering food. I don’t want to recall more of the experience. Honestly, if you don’t have a stable job or if life outside is too stressful, life in the detention center is a kind of enjoyment, a life without worries. But for me, it wasted a lot of time and delayed things. My competitions were postponed, and my research was delayed.</p>
<p>I was successfully released on July 27. My parents picked me up outside the gate. I first got a haircut and then went to the hotel to change into clean clothes. Finally, I went to the school to see my counselor and the party secretary, but they weren’t there. After a simple meal, we went to Binhai New Area for a visit to see the sea in Tianjin. Afterward, I drove back to Yantai, which was also my first time driving on the highway. On this trip, I experienced a lot, from sunny days to heavy rain and then to rain clearing up. In Shandong, around the Zibo area, there was a heavy rainstorm, and on the highway, visibility was less than five meters in some places. I was quite worried at that time, but now that I think about it, if I survived this, what else is there to fear? I also hope my life will be like this experience, where there is always a rainbow after the storm.</p>
<p>As of today, September 17, 2024, it’s been almost three weeks since the new semester started, including the summer term（小学期）. Today is the Mid-Autumn Festival, and the school hasn’t issued any disciplinary actions yet, maybe because they’re too busy. But I hope the punishment will be light.</p>
<p>The impact on me is still quite significant.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Party Membership</strong>: From the beginning of the incident, all my personal party membership materials were taken back by the party committee and handed over to the organization department. Higher authorities need to review my materials, so it will likely be tough for me to join the party in the future.</li>
<li><strong>Disciplinary Action</strong>: Since the school will issue disciplinary actions, which last for a year, even if it’s the lightest punishment of a demerit, the one-year period will end right at my guaranteed postgraduate study application time on September 26. Besides, my situation is severe, and it’s highly likely I’ll be placed on probation, which requires an application for removal, dragging it out even longer. Therefore, getting a guaranteed postgraduate spot is unlikely for me. I fought hard for my second-year grades for a whole year, only to have my dream of guaranteed postgraduate study ruined by this incident.</li>
<li><strong>Future Civil Service Exams</strong>: It will be much more difficult for me to take civil service exams in the future since I have an administrative penalty. Although administrative penalties are generally acceptable for most civil servant positions, my school records contain a disciplinary action, and although there is a removal document, it still has some impact. Unless I achieve more outstanding results during my postgraduate studies, this might offset some of the impact.</li>
</ol>
<p>Currently, I’m back in my previous study environment, but the mindset I had before is gone. Seeing other students studying hard and preparing for guaranteed postgraduate study, I can’t help but recall my hard work during my second year. Ouch, time flies and never returns. Maybe this is how fate plays tricks on people. Perhaps my life had to go through this hurdle, but no matter what, what’s coming will come, what needs to be experienced will be experienced, and hard work is still necessary. Some may say this is related to my parents’ education. I think my parents have educated me well, but maybe it’s my personality and ignorance of the unknown world that led to my current situation. I hope this incident can make me more mature.</p>
<p><strong>Currently, I haven’t told my classmates the real situation. On one hand, I don’t want it to affect my reputation because I’m not someone who steals. I have some prestige among my classmates. On the other hand, I want to protect myself from attacks and criticism from others. After all, no one wants their embarrassing past brought up again.</strong></p>
<p>Right now, my goal is clear. I can’t stay in Tianjin anymore. Beijing, the city closest to Tianjin and the capital, is undoubtedly the best choice. I aim to take the postgraduate entrance exam for Peking University’s Software and Microelectronics School, hoping this time I won’t let myself down.</p>
